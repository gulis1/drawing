      This basic image editor can resize, crop, or rotate an image, apply simple

      picture (cut/copy/paste/drag/â€¦)
    </p>
    <!-- IMPORTANT: complete description of the application (2/3) -->
    <p>
      And of course, you can draw! Using tools such as the pencil, the straight
      line, the curve tool, many shapes, several brushes, and their various
      colors and options.

    <release version="1.2.0" date="2022-08-21">
      <description>
        <p>
          Version 1.2.0 improves the transformation tools: their previews are
          now consistently applied when you change the active tool without
          clicking on "apply".
        </p>
        <p>
          The text tool is more intuitive to use, with distinct areas on the
          canvas to edit, move and insert the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          A former option of the paint bucket tool, which didn't belong there,
          has been improved and moved to the eraser tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transparency is henceforth correctly preserved when the "skew" tool
          expands the canvas with a solid color.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can now adjust the position of the canvas when you're cropping it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The option to use a color editor by default has been moved from the
          main window to the preferences window, and its bug has been fixed.
        </p>

    <release version="1.0.1" date="2022-04-09">
      <description>
        <!-- very generic release notes i use for ALL minor updates, please -->
        <!-- translate this one! -->
        <p>
          Version 1.0.1 features several minor bug fixes, and various new
          translations.
        </p>
        <p>
          By popular demand, the "highlighter" tool is now enabled by default,
          and the message dialog to warn you about the release notes is less
          intrusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main improvement in this update is the zoom workflow: since the
          version 1.0.0 it's possible to zoom in very deep, but the process was
          very slow, and the view didn't stay well centered around the mouse
          pointer; and once at 2000%%, scrolling up or down, or left or right,
          was quite violent.
          These problems should all have disappeared in this new version!
        </p>
        <p>
          Incorrect command line parsing when using the app outside of a
          flatpak sandbox has also been fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For users on elementary OS, a small issue concerning window resizing
          has been mended too.
        </p>

    <release version="1.0.0" date="2022-03-26">
      <description>
        <p>
          Version 1.0.0 improves rendering performance, which is visible when
          editing large images with a poor CPU.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can now use the new "skew" tool, to tilt an image from a rectangle
          to a parallelogram. Such a deformation can be applied horizontally or
          vertically.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can select tools with keyboard accelerators (Alt+letter). This may
          not work yet with languages using a non-latin alphabet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zooming very deep is now possible, and the rendering will be very
          crisp, even at 2000%%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pressing "ctrl" will display the cursor coordinates in a tooltip. If
          you do it while using a tool, it may display additional data, for
          example the dimensions of the shape you're drawing!
        </p>
        <p>
          Pressing "shift", or "alt" when using a tool enables specific options,
          such as locking the direction for the "line" tool, or changing the
          filling style of a shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the "scale" tool, you may optionally set the new size as a
          relative percentage rather than an absolute value in pixels.
        </p>
