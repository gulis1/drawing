  <title>What's new?</title>
  <p>The most recent versions are listed first.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Version 1.2.0</title>
    <p>
      The <link xref="tools_transform">transformation tools</link> now
      consistently apply their preview when you change the active tool without
      clicking on "apply".
    </p>
    <p>
      The text tool is more intuitive to use, with distinct areas on the
      canvas to edit, move and insert the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      A former option of the paint bucket tool, which didn't belong there,
      has been improved and moved to the eraser tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transparency is henceforth correctly preserved when the "skew" tool
      expands the canvas with a solid color.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can now adjust the position of the canvas when you're cropping it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The option to use a color editor by default has been moved from the
      main window to <link xref="preferences">the preferences window</link>, and
      its bug has been fixed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 1.0.1</title>
    <p>
      By popular demand, the "highlighter" tool is now enabled by default,
      and the message dialog to warn you about the release notes is less
      intrusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main improvement in this update is the zoom workflow: since the
      version 1.0.0 it's possible to zoom in very deep, but the process was
      very slow, and the view didn't stay well centered around the mouse
      pointer; and once at 2000%%, scrolling up or down, or left or right, was
      quite violent.
      These problems should all have disappeared in this new version!
    </p>
    <p>
      Incorrect command line parsing when using the app outside of a flatpak
      sandbox has also been fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For users on elementary OS, a small issue concerning window resizing has
      been mended too.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 1.0.0</title>

    <subsection>
      <title>Performance</title>
      <p>
        This new version improves rendering performance, which is visible when
        editing large images with a poor CPU.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's still not perfect, but it's better!
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Keyboard controls</title>
      <p>
        You can select tools with keyboard accelerators (<key>Alt</key>+letter).
        This may not work yet with languages using a non-latin alphabet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pressing <key>Ctrl</key> will display the cursor coordinates in a
        tooltip. If you do it while using a tool, it may display additional data, for
        example the dimensions of the shape you're drawing!
      </p>
      <p>
        Pressing <key>Shift</key>, or <key>Alt</key> when using a tool enables
        specific options, such as locking the direction for the "line" tool, or
        changing the filling style of a shape.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>New tool!</title>
      <p>
        You can now use the new <link xref="tools_transform#skew">"skew" tool
        </link>, to tilt an image from a rectangle to a parallelogram. Such a
        deformation can be applied horizontally or vertically.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>New options!</title>
      <p>
        Using <link xref="tools_transform#scale">the "scale" tool</link>, you
        may optionally set the new size as a relative percentage rather than an
        absolute value in pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to a new option, the highlighter will draw straighter, less messy
        lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pixel rendering is now very sharp when the image is very
        <link xref="zoom_preview">zoomed in</link>, and the pencil is more
        precise, so you can draw each pixel precisely.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Translations</title>
      <p>
        The version 1.0.0 also features new updates to many translations, such
        as czech, croatian, german, hebrew, and many more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The help manual you're reading is now mostly translated in spanish,
        russian, and turkish.
      </p>
      <p>
        A huge "thank you" to contributors all around the world!
      </p>
    </subsection>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.5</title>

    <p>
      Changing the view's position within the thumbnail preview now dynamically
      and immediately updates the view, instead of only reacting to your the
      click release.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text tool gains an option to use a thicker outline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the thumbnail preview and the blending mode selection have become
      more reliable and efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The version 0.8.5 also features new translations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.4</title>

    <p>
      Undoing several operations one after another should be less slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not possible anymore to reload the picture from the disk if it has
      never been saved on the disk to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text tool gains an option to disable anti-aliasing.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.3</title>

    <p>
      After rotating the selection, it had an incorrectly big height, but
      now it's fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outline of the <link xref="tools_selection">free selection</link> is
      now visible even when the image is very zoomed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In specific configurations, opening a file would open a second tab with an
      empty image. This weird behaviour should have disappeared.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.2</title>

    <p>
      The boundaries of the canvas are now always visibly delimited, to better
      render the area where you can draw, even if the canvas is transparent. It
      also helps to see what parts of the selection may disappear when you will
      unselect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <link xref="tools_transform">Transform tools</link> can now draw a preview
      of the pixels they may create outside of the current canvas, which makes
      the 'crop', 'scale', and 'rotate' tools more intuitive to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The straight line tool has a new option to lock its angle, so you can
      draw perfect horizontal, vertical, or 45Â° strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The `--edit-clipboard` command line option now works better with Wayland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scaling an image using the numerical inputs now preserves the original
      proportions of the image (unless the "never keep proportions" option
      is enabled).
    </p>
    <p>
      This version of the app is compatible with older GNOME versions
      (Ubuntu LTS 18.04).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.1</title>

    <p>
      You can now crop or expand the canvas to an "automatic" size based on the
      current selection size, using new actions available in the selection
      menus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bug, where the "crop" tool could erase the image under certain
      conditions, has been fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the preferences window, there is now an option to select if you
      prefer the dark theme variant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several minor options have been added to the tools:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item><p>
        The orientation of the calligraphic nib (<gui style="button">Brush</gui>
        tool);
      </p></item>
      <item><p>
        Various ways to censor an information using filters, with a far quicker
        workflow, as an option of the <gui style="button">Eraser</gui> tool;
      </p></item>
      <item><p>
        An "outline" option to the <gui style="button">Pencil</gui>,
        <gui style="button">Line</gui> and <gui style="button">Curve</gui>
        tools, to get better contrast, or just a cool effect around your lines.
      </p></item>
    </list>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Version 0.8.0</title>

    <p>
      The <link xref="fullscreen">fullscreen mode</link> has been completely
      redesigned to provide an easier yet less intrusive access to the tools and
      their options.
    </p>
    <p>
      The help manual has been splitted in smaller pages to be easier to read,
      and several buttons to access it have been added across the application.
    </p>

    <subsection>
      <title>New tools</title>
      <p>
        You can now use a tablet and a stylus to <link xref="tools_classic#brushes">
        draw with pressure-sensitive brushes</link>, available under the new
        optional 'brush' tool: a simple brush, an airbrush, a hairy brush, and a
        calligraphic nib.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>New options for existing tools</title>
      <list>
        <item><p>
          The <link xref="tools_selection">selection tools</link> have a new,
          more rich, more readable bottom pane.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          <link xref="tools_transform#filters">Filters</link> have been
          rewritten to be more reliable, and a new filter to harmoniously
          increase contrast has been added.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          When you move or delete the selection, now the pixels left behind can
          optionally be a specific color, rather than always transparency.
          This specific color can be excluded from the selection. That feature
          is complex to explain with words, try it yourself you'll see.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          The eraser tool now as options: it can use a specific color, rather
          than always transparency. This option has the same value as the
          selection replacement color mentioned above. This tool also have a new
          icon, based on the Adwaita theme.
        </p></item>
        <item><p>
          Options such as the text background type, the shape filling style, or
          the aforementioned eraser/selection replacement color, are now
          persisted when closing the application.
        </p></item>
      </list>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Color modes</title>
      <p>
        The user interface for selecting the <link xref="tools_classic_colors">
        active color application mode</link> has been redesigned to better show
        the accurate label, and better organize the possible modes as submenus.
      </p>
      <media type="image" mime="image/png" width="80%" its:translate="no"
             src="figures/screenshot_color_palette.png" />
      <p>
        The "blur" mode has been removed, which simplifies the situation and
        allows <link xref="tools_classic">several tools</link> ("shapes" and
        "brushes") to get support for the color application modes in general.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Bugs fixed</title>
      <p>
        Coordinates of the selection were lost when unselecting a selection
        defined by an undo.
      </p>
